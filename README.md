# WriteDown

My attempt at a Markdown editor similar to MarkdownPad.

## Why?

Because I wanted an open sourced alternative to MarkdownPad that is feature
complete (i.e. I don't have to install a third party program to use the HTML
preview) and that I could use offline (stuff like SimpleMDE is nice and all, but
I'd rather have a desktop app than a fancy web page).

## Special Thanks To...

* [CefSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp) - The Chromium wrapper
used for the HTML preview
* [ScintillaNET](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET) - The Scintilla
wrapper used for the text editor.
* [MarkDig](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig) - Convert's Markdown to
HTML super quickly and handles GitHub-flavor Markdown and emoji shortnames
for me.
* [MDITabControl](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/16436/A-highly-configurable-MDI-tab-control-from-scratch) -
The best customizable tab control for DotNet out there.
